# User Management API Project
# Overview
The User Management API is a RESTful web service built with Flask (Python) to efficiently manage user information. This project allows for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user records, demonstrating my backend development skills and knowledge of handling HTTP requests and JSON data.

# Key Features
- Create User: Add new users by sending their name and email through a POST request, with each user getting a unique ID.

- Retrieve Users: Get a list of all users via a GET request, returning their information in JSON format.

- Get User by ID: Fetch details of a specific user using their unique ID, ensuring the user exists before returning data.

- Update User: Modify user information such as name and email through a PUT request.

- Delete User: Remove a user from the system with a DELETE request, maintaining a clean dataset.

# Technical Stack
- Framework: Flask
- Language: Python
- Data Format: JSON
- Environment: Visual Studio Code
- Testing Tool: Postman

# Implementation Steps
- Setup: Installed Flask and created the application structure.
- Endpoint Development: Defined API endpoints for user management functions.
- HTTP Method Handling: Implemented functions for POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Testing: Used Postman to test all endpoints, ensuring proper functionality.
- Documentation: Created clear documentation for each endpoint with expected input and output.

# Challenges and Learning Outcomes
- Error Handling: Learned to manage errors, such as handling requests for non-existent users.
- API Testing: Improved skills in testing and debugging APIs using Postman.
- Understanding RESTful Principles: Gained a solid understanding of RESTful API design concepts.

# Conclusion
The User Management API project showcases my backend development abilities and my proficiency in Python and Flask. It provides a strong foundation for further learning in areas like database integration and API security.
